## 1、According to the von Neumann architecture, List basic parts of a computer.

(1)A processing unit that contains an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers.

(2)A control unit that contains an instruction register and program counter.

(3)Memory that stores data and instructions.

(4)External mass storage.

(5)Input and output mechanisms.

## 2、A computer has 64 MB (megabytes) of memory. How many bits are needed to address any single byte in memory?

64MB=2^26bytes
26 bits

## 3、List basic parts of a CPU, include cache or not?
1、	Control unit

2、	Arithmetic logic unit

3、	Memory management unit (MMU)

4、	Clock rate

5、	Integer range

6、	Virtual CPUs

don't include cache

## 4、What mean secondary storage. List some on your PC.
secondary storage is a non-volatile memory (does not lose stored data when the device is powered down) that is not directly accessible by the CPU, because it is not accessed via the input/output channels (it is an external device).

IN MY PC

 (1)USB flash drives(U盘)

（2）A hard disk drive （硬盘）

（3） compact disc（CD光盘）

# 5、使用维基百科，解释以下概念：

## 1）CPU
A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. 

## 2）RAM
Random-access memory (RAM /ræm/) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. 

## 3) ROM
Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges.

## 4)bus(computing)
In computer architecture, a bus[1] (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers.
